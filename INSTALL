ZoteroXmlImporter is not bundled as a ready-to-install .xpi file for Firefox,
you need to manually make its directory tree known to your Firefox
installation - by creating a "Firefox extension proxy file":

1. Close Firefox

2. Create a text file in the "extensions" directory under your Firefox profile
directory, e.g. in 

  ~/.mozilla/firefox/extensions/b47c11.default/extensions/

with the name

  ZoteroXmlImporter@jsteeb.de

3. The contents of this file must be the path to the directory that contains
the install.rdf file of ZoteroXmlImporter, e.g. 

D:\User\ZoteroXmlImporter\impl\

Windows users: use the drive name (CAPS) and backslashes instead of frontslashes
(e.g. "C:\sam\workspace\toolbar\helloWorldtoolbar\").
Remember to include the closing slash and remove any trailing whitespace.

4. Restart Firefox

--
To use the importer, open Zotero and go menu "Activities" (button at the top
right of your Zotero collections) and select "Zotero XML import".
