What is it?
====================

ZoteroXmlImporter extends Zotero by providing import of data into Zotero from a
simple XML format.

"Zotero [zoh-TAIR-oh] ... a free, easy-to-use Firefox extension to help you
collect, manage, cite, and share your research sources."
(http://www.zotero.org/)

ZoteroXmlImporter is also an extension for the Firefox browser, it works as a
plugin for Zotero - you need an appropriate version of Zotero installed.


For whom is it?
====================

ZoteroXmlImporter is for you if you 

1. have data in any format that is not natively supported by Zotero, AND

2. you are able to convert your data format to the simple XML format supported
by ZoteroXmlImporter.

If you are clever enough, you better use the RDF import format of Zotero,
which is XML based, too, and has the advantage of being completely integrated
and supported by Zotero.

In the meantime, ZoteroXmlImporter may be helpful. Its elements are simply the
names of Zotero item types and fields, like

<?xml version='1.0'?>
<zotero-import>
<document>
  <title>Gardening and more</title>
  <publisher>Hans Dampf</publisher>
  <language>en-US</language>
  <tag>Top10</tag>
  <tag>Gardening</tag>
  <note>Should read this again <strong>soon!</strong></note>
</document>
</zotero-import>


Features, Restrictions
======================

- imports
  * all "regular" bibliographic items (artwork, ... webpage) with child notes
    and tags and links
  * top-level note items with tags and links
  into the main collection only (not into the currently selected sub-collection).

- does not import
  * notes for links
  * attachments
  * structured "creators" (e.g. imports one author string "Hans Dampf", no
    firstname/lastname structure)

- no checking except when each item is passed to Zotero

- rollback if import of some items fails

- no checking of field formats (date strings like "yesterday" or "meouw" are
  passed to Zotero and accepted)

- progress meter seems to come up only finally :-(

- see TODO in the code


Import format
======================

See test/generatedAll.xml for an example file.
The file has been generated by

  scripts/computeItemTypeFields.html

which also created the RelaxNG syntax description

  design/zotero-import.rnc

  NOTE that this file does not correctly describe the HTML contents of <note>
  elements (it should allow all HTML elements...).

The script also creates an HTML listing of Zotero item types and their
supported fields. You need to feed the script with a Zotero system.sql
file. The one used for the files above was from Zotero 2.0:

  https://www.zotero.org/trac/browser/extension/branches/2.0/system.sql
